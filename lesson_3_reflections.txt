When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share files or a project for someone else to view or work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You don't want changes being pushed that are not finished and you don't want to many commits going on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy within GitHub only that keeps info about original repository and owner.
    Clone is a copy that can be local-local or local-GitHub. No history is kept about original.
    Branch is when you go off of the Master and make changes separately that will not affect the Master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can compare the changes and conflicts of the merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I don't know, email or IM or something. That would be messy and inefficient.
    Git and GitHub are definitely easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You don't want to mess up the master. Also when others are making changes at the 
    same time you can merge to the master when you are done instead of messing up the master
    and getting changes mixed up and merged incorrectly.
