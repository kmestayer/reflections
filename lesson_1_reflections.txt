How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The diff showed where there were differences in the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You could copy and paste some old code and re-use it. You could review past bugs that you made also.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro - save when you want, like when you have completed a small task or bug
Con - You might forget to commit over a long period of time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Its faster and easier.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log will show you the commit history of all the commits in the repository. 
Git diff will show the lines of code that were changed between the commits that you specify in the command.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's easy to check old code and revert back to it and/or fix bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I dunno. :)
