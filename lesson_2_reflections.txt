What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates git metadata so git can track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is where you put files that are ready to be commited.
You can specify certain files that you want to commit. You don't have to commit all files in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only commit the files that you updated.
